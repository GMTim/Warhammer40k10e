>- Resolve any other rules that occur in the Command Phase

#### Battle-Shock
>- Take a Battle-shock test for each unit from your army on the battlefield that is Below Half-strength.
>- Roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the unit's Leadership, the test is passed. Otherwise, the unit is Battle-shocked until the start of your next Command phase.
>- Battle-shocked units have an OC of 0 and their controlling player cannot use Stratagems to affect them.
>- Battle-shocked units must take Desperate Escape tests if they Fall Back.

## 2. Movement Phase
>1. **Move Units**
>2. **Reinforcements**

#### Move Units
>- When a unit moves it can make a Normal move, Advance, or Remain Stationary.
>- Units that are within Engagement Range of any enemy models can only Fall Back or Remain Stationary.

##### Normal Moves
>- Normal Move: Models move up to M".
>- Cannot move within Engagement Range of any enemy models.

##### Advance Moves
>- Advance Move: Models move up to M+D6".
>- Cannot move within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
>- Units that Advance cannot shoot or charge this turn.

##### Fall Back Moves
>- Fall Back Move: Models move up to M".
>- Units that Fall Back cannot shoot or declare a charge in the same turn.
>- Models can move over enemy models when Falling Back, but you must take Desperate Escape tests for them before they do so [excluding models that are Titanic or can Fly].
>- If a Battle-shocked unit is selected to Fall Back, take a Desperate Escape test for every model in that unit.
>- Desperate Escape Tests: Roll one D6. On a 1-2, one model from that unit is destroyed.

##### Moving Over Terrain
>- Models can move freely over terrain features 2" or less in height.
>- Models cannot move through terrain features taller than 2", but can climb up and down them.

##### Flying
>- Fly models can move over enemy models when they make a Normal, Advance, or Fall Back move.
>- Fly models that start or end a move on a terrain feature measure distance moved through the air when they make a Normal, Advance, or Fall Back move.

#### Reinforcements
>- Reserves Unit: A unit that starts the battle in a location other than the battlefield.
>- Always count as having made a Normal move in the turn they are set up on the battlefield.
>- Any specified distance from enemy models applies to horizontal distance.
>- Any Reserves unit not set up on the battlefield by the end of the battle counts as destroyed.

## 3. Shooting Phase
>1. **Select Eligible Unit**
>2. **Select Targets**
>3. **Make Ranged Attacks**
>4. **Repeat For Next Eligible Unit**

#### Select Eligible Unit (Shooting)
>- A unit is eligible to shoot unless any of the following apply:
>   - That unit Advanced this turn.
>   - That unit Fell Back this turn.

#### Select Targets
>- Before a unit shoots, select the targets for all of its ranged weapons.
>- At least one model in the target unit must be visible to the attacking model and within range of the weapon being used.
>- Models with more than one ranged weapon can shoot them at the same or different targets, but models cannot split [attacks](./making-attacks.md) from the same weapon across more than one target.
>- Models in the same unit can shoot at the same or different targets.

##### Lone Operative
>- Unless part of an Attached unit, this unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 12".

#### Make Ranged Attacks
>- When a model shoots a weapon, it makes a number of [attacks](./making-attacks.md) equal to that weapon's Attacks characteristic.
>- Resolve all [attacks](./making-attacks.md) against one unit before resolving [attacks](./making-attacks.md) against any other unit.
>- Resolve all [attacks](./making-attacks.md) made with the same weapon profile before resolving [attacks](./making-attacks.md) with any other profile.
>- If a weapon was in range and its target was visible when selected, that weapon's [attacks](./making-attacks.md) can always be made.

##### Locked in Combat
>- Units cannot shoot while within Engagement Range of enemy units.
>- Units cannot shoot at targets within Engagement Range of friendly units.

##### Stealth
>- If every model in a unit has this ability, then each time a ranged attack is made against it, subtract 1 from that attack's Hit roll.

##### Big Guns Never Tire
>- Monsters and Vehicles can shoot, and be shot at, even while they are within Engagement Range of enemy units. Each time a ranged attack is made by or against such a unit, subtract 1 from that attack's Hit roll [unless shooting with a Pistol].

>   - That unit is an Aircraft unit.

#### Charging With A Unit
>- Charge Roll: 2D6".
>- Targets of a charge must be within 12" but do not need to be visible.
>- If the distance rolled is insufficient to move within Engagement Range of all targets while maintaining Unit Coherency, the charge fails.
>- Cannot move within Engagement Range of any unit that was not a target of the charge.
>- If the charge is successful, each model makes a Charge move less than or equal to the Charge roll, and must move into base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible.

##### Charging Over Terrain
>- Models can be moved freely over terrain features 2" or less in height.
>- Models cannot move through terrain features taller than 2", but can climb up and down them.

##### Charging With Flying Models
>- Fly models can move over other models when they make a Charge move.
>- Fly models that start or end a Charge move on a terrain feature measure distance moved through the air when they make a Charge move.

## 5. Fight Phase

>Units that can Fight First do so
>2. **Remaining Combats**

>   - It is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.
>   - It made a Charge move this turn.

#### Fight
##### 1. Pile In
>- Pile-in Move: Up to 3".
>- Every model that moves must end closer to the closest enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit [or no models can Pile In].

##### 2. Make Melee Attacks
##### Which Models Fight
>- A model can fight if it is within Engagement Range of an enemy unit.
>- A model can fight if it is in base-to-base contact with another model from its own unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with an enemy unit.

##### Select Weapon
>- Each model that can fight does so using one of its melee weapons.
>- Each model makes a number of [attacks](./making-attacks.md) equal to the Attacks characteristic of its selected weapon.

##### Select Targets
>- Select targets for all [attacks](./making-attacks.md) before any are resolved.
>- Attacking model must either be within Engagement Range of an enemy unit to target it, or in base-to-base contact with another model in its unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with that enemy unit.

##### Make Attacks
>- Resolve all [attacks](./making-attacks.md) against one unit before moving onto the next.
>- Resolve all [attacks](./making-attacks.md) with the same weapon profile before resolving any made with a different weapon profile.
>- All [attacks](./making-attacks.md) declared against a target unit are resolved, even if no models in that unit remain within Engagement Range.

##### 3. Consolidate
>- Consolidation Move: Up to 3".
>- Every model that moves must end closer to the closest enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit if possible.
>- If the above is not possible, each model can move towards the closest objective marker, but this must result in the unit being within range of it and in Unit Coherency.
>- If the above is also not possible, no models can Consolidate.
