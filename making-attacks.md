## 1. Hit Roll
>- Hit Roll [Ranged Attack]: A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack's BS.
>- Hit Roll [Melee Attack]: A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack's WS.
>- Critical Hot: Unmodified Hit roll of 6. Always successful.
>- An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails.
>- A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.

> Strength > Toughness: 3+  
> Strength = Toughness: 4+  
> Strength < Toughness: 5+  
> Strength < Toughness /2: 6+

## 3. Allocate Attack
>- If a model in the target unit has already lost any wounds or had other attacks allocated to it this phase, the attack must be allocated to that model.

## 4. Saving Throw
>- Saving Throw: Roll one D6 and modify by the attack's AP. If the result is less than the Save of the model being rolled for, the saving throw is failed and that model suffers damage. Otherwise, that attack is saved.
>- An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails.
>- A saving throw can never be improved by more than +1.

#### Invulnerable Saves
>- Invulnerable Save: Never modified by an attack's AP.
>- The controlling player can choose to use either a model's invulnerable save or its Save characteristic.

## 5. Inflict Damage
>- A model loses a number of wounds equal to the attack's Damage characteristic.
>- If a model is destroyed by an attack, any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost.

#### Mortal Wounds
>- Each mortal wound inflicted on a unit causes one model in that unit to lose one wound.
>- No saving throws can be made against mortal wounds.
>- Mortal wounds inflicted by attacks always apply after any normal damage, even if that damage was saved.

#### Feel No Pain
>- Feel No Pain X+: Each time this model would lose a wound, roll one D6: if the result equals or exceeds 'X', that wound is not lost.

#### Deadly Demise
>- Deadly Demise X: When this model is destroyed, roll one D6. On a 6, each unit within 6" suffers 'X' mortal wounds.
